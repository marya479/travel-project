            <h3>Tokyo, the city of cherry blossoms</h3>
            <p>
              Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is a bustling metropolis known
              for its blend of traditional and modern culture. As one of the
              world's most populous urban areas, it offers a dynamic mix of
              historic temples, like Senso-ji in Asakusa, and cutting-edge
              architecture, such as the Tokyo Skytree. Tokyo is also a major
              economic hub, home to numerous multinational corporations and the

              shopping districts like Shibuya and Ginza, and vibrant nightlife
              in areas like Shinjuku and Roppongi. Despite its fast-paced
              lifestyle, Tokyo boasts serene parks and gardens, providing a
              peaceful contrast to its urban hustle.

                <h4>Koffee Mameya Kakeru</h4>
                <p>
                  Eiichi Kunimoto, the man behind one of Tokyo’s best known
                  coffee exports, Omotesando Koffee, is the mastermind of Koffee
                  Mameya Kakeru. Kakeru means “to multiply” in Japanese, and it
                  and that is essentially what they hope to introduce with this
                  shop—by offering a wide variety of beans for patrons to enjoy
                  as they please and to show the visitors the multiple
                  possibilities of the same coffee bean being interpreted into
                  different kinds of drinks.
                </p>

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Set in a former book publishing warehouse, Koffee Mameya
                  Kakeru is fashioned like a temple to the worship of coffee.
                  While some people are content with a takeaway cold brew, an
                  experience here won’t be complete without a proper sampling of
                  various roasts.

                <h4>Connel Coffee</h4>
                <p>
                  Its location in the Kenzo Tange-designed Sogetsu Kaikan
                  building in Akasaka is enough reason for architecture lovers
                  to make a pilgrimage, but another pull is the involvement of
                  prolific Japanese design firm, Nendo, which is behind the
                  creation of this sleek cafe.
                </p>
                <h5>Address:</h5>
                <p>Sogetsu Hall 2F, 7-2-21 Akasaka, Minato</p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  The structure’s walls and ceilings were left untouched but
                  Nendo unified the space by using the same materials
                  throughout, specifically the “stream” flooring he designed.
                  The lounge features original Knoll Tulip Chairs and Tulip
                  Tables by Eero Saarinen, which have been repaired. The quiet,
                  intelligent design puts the focus on the view: the cafe
                  overlooks the Akasaka Estate as well as a stone garden by
                  Isamu Noguchi.

                <h4>Kayaba Coffee</h4>
                <p>
                  This kissaten in Tokyo’s Yanaka neighbourhood dates back to
                  1938 and experienced a rebirth in 2009 through the help of
                  influential art gallery, Scai the Bathhouse. Homegrown firm
                  Yuko Nagayama & Associates was behind the renovation, which
                  fuses traditional Japanese design with mid-Century modern
                  touches.
                </p>
                <h5>Address:</h5>
                <p>6-1-29 Yanaka, Taito</p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  As it’s housed in a machiya (a wooden townhouse), it was
                  appropriate to find old-school furniture to decorate Kayaba.
                  However, clever additions like a mirrored roof add a
                  contemporary twist to the space.
